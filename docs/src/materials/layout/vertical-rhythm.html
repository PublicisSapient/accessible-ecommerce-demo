notes: |
  The designs are based on a grid unit of 8px,
  which has been saved as a sass variable: `$grid-unit`.
  For margins above/below components, gutter widths, etc.
  it is recommended that a multiple of the grid unit is used
  rather than fixed pixel values, ie: `margin-bottom: $grid-unit * 2`
  If it's felt that shorthands for these values would be easier, we
  can add a bunch of new variables like `vs-xl` for vertical space xl,
  or some similar convention.

notes: |
  The typography for the site is using the 62.5% font size on the `html`
  with rem units for the rest of the site. This approach allows for easier
  mental math to create root-relative font sizes, while also allowing users to change
  their default font sizes (because the reset is a % and not fixed px).
  The 62.5% takes the *general* browser default of 16px and sets it to 10px.
  The `body` has been set to `1.6rem` which translates back to 16px.
  For users that change their default browser font size, the relative size
  differences between the various components and elements will be preserved.

The goal is to open up online shopping functionality for the 770 million people in the world living with disabilities because it serves as a resource for how to make e-commerce storefronts accessible for both designers and developers. </p> <p>This was and continues to be a tremendous undertaking, executed via a series of hackathons. In each hackathon, we paired 2 User Experience Designers with 2 Experience Technologists, and as a team they designed and built the component or set of components that were assigned to them, all within 4 hours. Post hackathon, we had an Experience Technologist compile the components into a page, and we engaged a Visual Designer to help us with the polish. </p> <p>Prior to the hackathons, we had unrolled screen reader training for the Experience Technologist and creative team members (User Experience Designers and Visual Designers), which taught them empathy and how their audience navigates the web. We also created a curriculum of best accessibility practices applied to common website components that we call the “Accessibility Deep Dive” sessions. Each session took a close look at common user interface components used on e-commerce experiences, like the global navigation menu, the product listing grid, filters, and sorting mechanisms, and we considered how they should work for people using assistive devices. The result is that we are teaching people to ride bicycles before we get them to design the perfect bike. </p> <p>Truly inclusive experiences require both thoughtful design and execution. We need inclusive designers and developers who will help us finally arrive at a web that is truly accessible, enabling our most vulnerable populations to fully participate in online services and content, and to truly feel a part of our community. An accessible experience skillset is in great demand, but accessibility compliance is not something that is taught in most schools. Thus we took it upon ourselves to introduce these skills, and to create the next generation of designers and developers who understand accessibility. While doing so, we have collectively created a resource for the world to use as an example of how to make a thoughtful and beautiful accessible e-commerce experience. We will continue to add more functionality to the site in the coming months.</p> </section> <section class="about-us__section"> <img src="https://dummyimage.com/864x400/adadad/ffffff.png&text=%3CTeam+Photo%3E" alt=""> <h3 id="our-team" class="about-us__section-title">Our Team</h3> </section> <section class="about-us__section"> <h3 id="unfulfilled-promise" class="about-us__section-title">The Unfulfilled Promise of the Internet</h3> <h4 class="about-us__subsection-title">Introduction</h4> <p>From the late 1990s onward, the internet gradually became part of our lives, until in 2011 it was estimated that 2.1 billion people regularly used “the Web”. With more and more people using the internet, physical modes of content were steadily replaced by electronic modes of content. A big part of the shift was that commerce at physical locations has been replaced or augmented by e-commerce storefronts. This shift had the potential to remove many of the barriers to communication that existed for people with disabilities in the physical world, but only if websites were designed and developed accessibly.</p> <p>Over the last 25 years, technological advancements and human ingenuity have brought us search engines like Google, a variety of payment systems like Paypal, Apple Pay, and bitcoin, and e-commerce giants who have created a market where e-commerce comprised more than 10% of US sales in 2017.</p> <p>Yet our studies show that there are still no e-commerce sites that are completely accessible and usable.</p> <h4 class="about-us__subsection-title">Identifying the problem</h4> <p>A selection of the top retail e-commerce sites by e-commerce sales and visitor popularity were audited for accessibility at a high level using manual keyboard and screen reader testing. Results show that of the top 10 e-commerce retailers, both by revenue and user selection, only 4 of them are likely to be usable by people restricted to using assistive browsing devices such as screen readers or their keyboard alone. The 4 that are possible to use received low grades (C or D) for usability. For experiences that failed, common issues included inaccessible modal window content, unclear link labels, or coding errors that result in an excessive amounts of extra tab stops. For keyboard experiences with low scores, issues included interactivity that is unavailable to keyboard users, unexpected focus order of links, and navigation menus that are difficult to use.</p> <p>When it was possible to complete the browse and checkout experience, it was usually only with the most basic of search criteria. For example, a mouse user could search for curtains and then filter by color and length, whereas a screen reader and keyboard user was only likely to achieve success if their original search term included all of the criteria (e.g. “yellow sheer curtains”).</p> <p>This exercise shows that accessible experiences are trailing far behind traditional experiences, even when it comes to the world’s most high performing e-commerce websites. The majority do not work at all for screen reader users, and those that do work are not as usable as they could be.</p> <p>Most people today can hardly conceive of life without the Internet, or without e-commerce. But these online retail stores are effectively CLOSED for this population of 770 million people in the world. This is a huge market that businesses should want to tap into, and it’s the right thing to do. We have the tools. The knowledge is out there.</p> <h4 class="about-us__subsection-title">So why aren’t all websites accessible?</h4> <p>The answer is because of a fundamental flaw in how web experiences are designed and developed. Would you ask someone who has only ever driven a car to design the perfect bicycle? Of course not. But that is effectively what agencies are doing when they ask designers and developers to create accessible experiences when they have never tried to navigate the web with assistive devices, for example with their keyboard alone (no mouse) or with a screen reader.</p> <p>Read our e-commerce accessibility audit in detail.</p> <a class="btn" href="#download">Download the audit</a> </section> <section class="about-us__section"> <h3 id="what-the-demo-is" class="about-us__section-title">What our demo is, and what it is not</h3> <ul class="what-the-demo__list"> <li class="what-the-demo__item"><strong>It is fully keyboard navigable and screen reader-friendly on a desktop browser in its current state.</strong> Navigate with your tab key to discover hidden wayfinding cues, and note how we tried to provide screen reader users with the appropriate amount of context and information as they navigated through the site. We will catch up on the mobile functionality later.</li> <li class="what-the-demo__item"><strong>It is not fully designed.</strong> Think of it as an interactive desktop wireframe right now. We are working out all of the interactions first, then applying an eye-catching design later.</li> <li class="what-the-demo__item"><strong>It is not fully functional</strong> at the moment. For example, right now you can’t add an item to your cart. We plan to make that work shortly. This is as far as we got for Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</li> <li class="what-the-demo__item"><strong>It is not representative of today’s best coding standards – yet. This code came out of multiple hackathon sessions.</strong> The point of the demo today is to showcase how an accessible e-commerce website should feel and behave. We will clean up the code later.</li> <li class="what-the-demo__item"><strong>It is not perfect.</strong> We didn’t want to waste time trying to make it perfect before getting it out there. The danger would be that it would never be perfect enough. Edward de Bono said it best: <strong>“An idea that is developed and put into action is more important than an idea that exists only as an idea.”</strong></li> </ul> </section> </main> </div> <ul style="display:none">  <li><a href="/accessible-ecommerce-demo/plp/index.html">Product Listing Page</a></li> <li><a href="/accessible-ecommerce-demo/pdp/index.html?product_id=1">Product Detail Page</a></li> <li><a href="/accessible-ecommerce-demo/cart/index.html">Cart Page</a></li> <li><a href="/accessible-ecommerce-demo/checkout/index.html">Checkout Page</a></li> <li><a href="/accessible-ecommerce-demo/review-order/index.html">Review Order Page</a></li> <li><a href="/accessible-ecommerce-demo/order-confirmation/index.html">Confirmation Page</a></li> </ul> <footer data-template="footer"></footer> <div data-template="modal"></div> <div data-template="construction-modal"></div> <script src="/accessible-ecommerce-demo/scripts.96d9cf3c.js"></script>
